        so the user asked, \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That seems pretty straightforward. Let
        me think. In basic arithmetic, adding two numbers together. 2 plus 2 is a
        fundamental question. Let me make sure I''m not missing anything here. Maybe
        they want a more detailed explanation? Or perhaps there''s a trick to it?
        Wait, no, 2 + 2 is one of the simplest addition problems. The answer should
        be 4. But maybe they want to confirm the method? Like, using fingers or counting
        blocks? Or maybe they''re testing if I know the basic math facts. Alternatively,
        could there be a different interpretation? For example, in some contexts,
        like binary numbers, 2 + 2 would be 100 in binary, which is 4 in decimal.
        But that''s probably overcomplicating it. The question is likely asking for
        the standard arithmetic answer. Let me just verify. Yes, 2 + 2 equals 4 in
        base 10. I think that''s it. I should present the answer clearly and confirm
        that it''s correct.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n2 + 2 equals **4**. \n\nThis is
        a basic arithmetic operation where adding two units to another two units results
        in a total of four units."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":265,"total_tokens":281}}
