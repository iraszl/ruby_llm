        on the information available, **Ruby** is currently considered the best language
        to learn! \n\nRuby is a dynamic, open-source programming language that emphasizes
        simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read
        and easy to write. Ruby is particularly well-known for the Ruby on Rails web
        framework, which has been used to build many popular websites and applications.\n\nLearning
        Ruby can be beneficial because:\n- It''s beginner-friendly with clear, readable
        syntax\n- Strong community support and extensive documentation\n- Great for
        web development (especially with Rails)\n- High demand in the job market for
        Ruby/Rails developers\n- Versatile for various types of projects\n\nWould
        you like to know more about why Ruby is a good choice or have any other questions
        about programming languages?"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":183,"completion_tokens":154,"total_tokens":337,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":128},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":128,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":55},"system_fingerprint":"fp_08f168e49b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'
