        political capital but also the largest city in France, serving as a major
        cultural, commercial, and historical center. It has a population of approximately
        2 million people as of 2025 and is located in the \u00cele-de-France region
        in north-central France[4]. Paris is famously nicknamed the \"City of Light\"
        for its historical role in the Enlightenment and its vibrant cultural scene[3][4][6].
        It has been the capital for most of French history since 987, with only rare
        exceptions, such as during World War II when Vichy served temporarily as the
        capital[1][5]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
