        the user asked, \"What''s the best language to learn?\" and I called the function
        best_language_to_learn, which returned \"Ruby\". Now I need to present this
        answer clearly.\n\nI should state that Ruby is the best language to learn.
        Maybe add a brief reason why Ruby is recommended, like its simplicity and
        readability. But since the function''s response is just \"Ruby\", I should
        stick to that unless there''s more context. The user might be looking for
        a recommendation, so perhaps mention that Ruby is great for beginners and
        versatile for web development. But keep it concise. Make sure the answer is
        helpful and directly addresses the query.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe best
        language to learn is **Ruby**. It is known for its simplicity, readability,
        and productivity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced
        developers alike. Ruby''s syntax emphasizes clarity, which helps in writing
        clean and maintainable code. Additionally, it is widely used in web development
        (e.g., with Ruby on Rails), further expanding its applicability."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":280,"completion_tokens":209,"total_tokens":489}}
