        on the information available, **Ruby** is currently recommended as the best
        language to learn. Ruby is a versatile, object-oriented programming language
        known for its elegant syntax and is particularly popular for web development
        (especially with the Ruby on Rails framework). It''s a great choice for beginners
        due to its readability and for experienced developers looking to build robust
