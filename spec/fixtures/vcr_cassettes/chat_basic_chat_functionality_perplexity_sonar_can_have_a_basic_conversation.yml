        is **4**[1][5].\n\nThis is because in basic arithmetic, addition of the integer
        2 and 2 yields 4. While there are certain mathematical systems or frameworks
        (such as modular arithmetic) where \"2 + 2\" might be defined differently
        (for example, 2 + 2 \u2261 1 mod 3), these are exceptions based on alternate
        definitions of addition and number sets rather than the usual integer arithmetic
        taught in schools[2].\n\nSome videos or proofs claiming \"2 + 2 = 5\" use
        incorrect manipulations or context-dependent rules and are not valid arithmetic
        operations in the conventional sense[3]. Therefore, universally accepted mathematics
        confirms that 2 plus 2 equals 4."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
