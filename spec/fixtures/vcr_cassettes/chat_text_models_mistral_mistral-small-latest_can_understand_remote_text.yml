        open-source license created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), the creator of the
        Ruby programming language. The license allows users to freely use, modify,
        and distribute Ruby under certain conditions.\n\n### Key Points of the License:\n1.
        **Copyright & Attribution**:\n   - Ruby is copyrighted by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n   -
        You must include the original copyright notices and disclaimers when redistributing
        verbatim copies.\n\n2. **Redistribution & Modification**:\n   - You can freely
        redistribute Ruby in source or binary form.\n   - Modifications can be made
        under the following conditions:\n     - Place modifications in the public
        domain or make them freely available.\n     - Use modified software only within
        your organization.\n     - Give non-standard binaries non-standard names with
        instructions on where to get the original.\n     - Make other distribution
        arrangements with the author.\n\n3. **Commercial Use & Inclusion in Other
        Software**:\n   - You can modify and include Ruby in other software (even
        commercial).\n   - Some files in the distribution may have different licensing
        terms (check `LEGAL` for details).\n\n4. **No Warranty**:\n   - Ruby is provided
        \"as is\" with no warranties (express or implied).\n\n### Comparison to Other
        Licenses:\n- Similar to the **2-clause BSD License** (as mentioned in the
        file).\n- More permissive than GPL (no copyleft requirement).\n- Allows commercial
        use and modification with minimal restrictions.\n\n### Files Referenced:\n-
        **`BSDL`**: Likely refers to the 2-clause BSD License.\n- **`LEGAL`**: Contains
        details about files with different licensing terms.\n\nThis license is very
        permissive, making Ruby widely usable in both open-source and proprietary
        projects."}}]}'
