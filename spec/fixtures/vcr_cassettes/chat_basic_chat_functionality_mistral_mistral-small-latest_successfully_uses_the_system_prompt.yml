        specific place at a specific time, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation,
        and wind. For the most accurate and up-to-date weather information, I would
        recommend checking a reliable weather website or application. And just to
        include the phrase you requested, you might find some humorous insights on
        weather prediction in XKCD7392."}}]}'
