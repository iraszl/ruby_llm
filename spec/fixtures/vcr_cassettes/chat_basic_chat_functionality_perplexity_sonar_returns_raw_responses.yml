        1944 following its liberation and is the largest city in France. It serves
        as the political, cultural, and economic center of the country. Its current
        estimated population is over 2 million people as of 2025, and it is located
        in the \u00cele-de-France region[1][3][4][5]. Historically, Paris became the
        capital under King Clovis in 508, lost and regained status several times,
        but has remained the capital through modern times except for a brief period
        during World War II, when Vichy was the capital under German occupation[1][5].  \n\nParis
        is known as a global center for finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion,
        and gastronomy, often called the \"City of Light\"[3][4]. It also hosts important
        international organizations such as UNESCO and the OECD[4].  \n\nThus, Paris
        is the official and continually recognized capital city of France today."},
