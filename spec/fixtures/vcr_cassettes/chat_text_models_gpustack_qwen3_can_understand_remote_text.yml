        `license.txt` file you provided outlines the licensing terms for **Ruby**,
        a programming language created by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. Here''s a breakdown
        of its contents:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points from the License**\n1. **Copyright
        and Author**  \n   - Ruby is copyrighted as free software by Matz (Yukihiro
        Matsumoto).  \n   - Redistribution and modification are allowed under **either**
        the **2-clause BSDL** (Berkeley Software Distribution License) **or** the
        conditions listed below.\n\n2. **Redistribution and Modification Conditions**  \n   -
        **Condition 1**:  \n     You can redistribute verbatim copies of the source
        code **without restriction**, provided you duplicate all original copyright
        notices and disclaimers.  \n   - **Condition 2**:  \n     If you modify the
        software, you must do **at least one** of the following:  \n     - Release
        modifications into the Public Domain or freely share them (e.g., via Usenet
        or allowing Matz to include them).  \n     - Use modified software only within
        your organization.  \n     - Rename non-standard binaries and include instructions
        to get the original source.  \n     - Make other distribution arrangements
        with Matz.  \n   - **Condition 3**:  \n     Distributing binaries or object
        code requires **at least one** of:  \n     - Include instructions to get the
        original source with binaries.  \n     - Provide machine-readable source code
        with the distribution.  \n     - Rename non-standard binaries and include
        instructions to get the original.  \n     - Make other arrangements with Matz.  \n   -
        **Condition 4**:  \n     You can modify and integrate parts of Ruby into other
        software (even commercial), **but some files** are not under these terms.
        Check the `LEGAL` file for exceptions.  \n   - **Condition 5**:  \n     Scripts
        or library files generated as input/output (e.g., from Ruby) are **not** automatically
        copyrighted by Ruby. They belong to the creator and can be sold commercially.  \n   -
        **Condition 6**:  \n     The software is provided **\"AS IS\"** with **no
        warranties** (including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for
        a specific purpose).\n\n---\n\n### **Important Notes**\n- The license is **permissive
        but with specific conditions**. It allows redistribution and modification
        but requires adherence to certain rules (e.g., preserving notices, handling
        modified versions, or renaming binaries).  \n- The **2-clause BSDL** (likely
        a variant of the BSD license) is referenced, but the conditions here are more
        detailed and tailored to Ruby.  \n- The license mentions additional files:  \n  -
        `BSDL`: The actual 2-clause BSD license text.  \n  - `LEGAL`: A file listing
        exceptions or special conditions for specific files in the Ruby distribution.  \n\n---\n\n###
        **Summary**\nThis license allows **free use, modification, and redistribution**
        of Ruby under specific conditions, balancing permissiveness with protections
        for the original author. To use Ruby, ensure compliance with the terms (e.g.,
        preserving notices, handling modified code, or checking `LEGAL` for exceptions).
        Always review the full license and related files (`BSDL`, `LEGAL`) for exact
        obligations.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1757843498,"id":"chatcmpl-wpwvBXl9cYlGisTDxHMIcDmows8dGkf0","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1262,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":598,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":12},"prompt_tokens_per_second":3599.7167869880827,"time_per_output_token_ms":9.811038034865295,"time_to_first_token_ms":151.123,"tokens_per_second":101.92601399019345,"total_tokens":1806}}'
