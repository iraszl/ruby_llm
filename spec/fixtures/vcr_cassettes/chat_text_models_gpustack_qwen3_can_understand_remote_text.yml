        `license.txt` file contains the licensing terms for **Ruby**, a programming
        language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Here''s a breakdown of its
        key points:\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the License**\n1. **Copyright and Author**  \n   -
        Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto (`matz@netlab.jp`).\n\n2.
        **Redistribution and Modification**  \n   - You can redistribute and modify
        Ruby under **either**:\n     - The **2-clause BSDL** license (refer to the
        `BSDL` file for details).\n     - The conditions listed below (custom terms).\n\n---\n\n###
        **Key Terms and Conditions**\n#### **1. Verbatim Copies (Source Code)**\n   -
        You may freely distribute verbatim copies of the source code **without restriction**,
        provided:\n     - All original copyright notices and disclaimers are duplicated.\n\n####
        **2. Modifications**\n   - If you modify the software, you must do **at least
        one** of:\n     - **a)** Place modifications in the Public Domain or make
        them freely available (e.g., share on Usenet or allow the author to include
        them).\n     - **b)** Use the modified software only within your organization.\n     -
        **c)** Name non-standard binaries with instructions on where to get the original
        distribution.\n     - **d)** Make other distribution arrangements with the
        author.\n\n#### **3. Binary Distribution**\n   - If distributing in object
        code or binary form, you must do **at least one** of:\n     - **a)** Include
        instructions (e.g., in a manual page) on where to get the original source.\n     -
        **b)** Accompany the distribution with machine-readable source code.\n     -
        **c)** Name non-standard binaries with instructions on the original distribution.\n     -
        **d)** Make other arrangements with the author.\n\n#### **4. Integration with
        Other Software**\n   - You may modify and include parts of Ruby in other software
        (even commercial), **except** for some files not written by Matz. Check the
        `LEGAL` file for details on those files.\n\n#### **5. Scripts and Library
        Files**\n   - Scripts/libraries generated as input/output by Ruby are **not
        automatically copyrighted** by Ruby. They belong to their creators and may
        be sold commercially or aggregated with Ruby.\n\n#### **6. Warranty Disclaimer**\n   -
        The software is provided **\"AS IS\"** with **no warranties** (explicit or
        implied), including fitness for a particular purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Important
        Notes**\n- This license combines elements of the **BSD license** with additional
        restrictions.\n- Some files in the Ruby distribution may have **different
        licensing terms** (check the `LEGAL` file for specifics).\n- The **2-clause
        BSDL** license (referenced in the file) is likely a variant of the BSD license,
        but its exact terms are not included here.\n\n---\n\n### **Use Cases**\n-
        **Open-source projects**: You can freely use, modify, and distribute Ruby
        under these terms.\n- **Commercial use**: Allowed if you comply with conditions
        (e.g., providing source code or proper attribution).\n- **Legal compliance**:
        Ensure you follow the license for all files, especially those not covered
        by these terms (check `LEGAL`).\n\nLet me know if you need help interpreting
        specific clauses or checking compliance!","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1757516808,"id":"chatcmpl-vtMVzzUp3dqe2E3RO2LiiiyOt4TWCXeL","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1248,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":564,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":544,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":12},"prompt_tokens_per_second":3138.377043694977,"time_per_output_token_ms":10.287978365384616,"time_to_first_token_ms":173.338,"tokens_per_second":97.20082648741213,"total_tokens":1792}}'
