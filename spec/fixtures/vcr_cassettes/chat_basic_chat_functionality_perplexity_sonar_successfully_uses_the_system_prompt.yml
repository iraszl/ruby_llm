        comfortable, with temperatures ranging from about 62\u00b0F (17\u00b0C) to
        75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). You can expect around 3 to 8 days of rain during the
        month, so carrying an umbrella is advisable. The overall conditions include
        mostly dry days with occasional rain, and about 10 hours of sunshine daily
        in New York[1][3].\n\nOn September 10, 2025, the immediate coastal areas remain
        cool with clouds and rain showers, keeping temperatures mild. A summer warm-up
        is expected to approach later in the week, with sunshine and mild weather
        from Thursday through the weekend, and a chance of showers possibly returning
        on Sunday[5].\n\nMore generally, weather describes the atmospheric conditions
        such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind, which vary by location
        and time. It influences daily activities and is shaped by factors like Earth''s
        rotation and latitude, making tropical weather more variable and harder to
        forecast than at higher latitudes[4].\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date
        information, checking a 14-day forecast before travel or outdoor plans is
        recommended[1][3]. XKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
